- jobmanagement (manage start jobs for predefined time, controll success, log management)
- use table job_check for all timestamps (after that delete table cleanclients, lastscan, upcheck)
- correct session handling.. handle outdated session for user which idle on homepage
- every action (stats and jobs) for ts3 has a check for slow mode?
- add list_rankup.php as menu entry in statistic and embed it (is the only logical way)
- add server-usage graph on index.php with following dropdown options
	# 1 Tag (alle 60 Minuten)
	set @a:=0; select u1.timestamp, u1.clients from (select @a:=@a+1,mod(@a,2) as test,timestamp,clients from server_usage) as u2, server_usage as u1 where u1.timestamp=u2.timestamp and u2.test='1' order by u2.timestamp desc limit 24;
	# 1 Woche (alle 6 Std)
	set @a:=0; select u1.timestamp, u1.clients from (select @a:=@a+1,mod(@a,12) as test,timestamp,clients from server_usage) as u2, server_usage as u1 where u1.timestamp=u2.timestamp and u2.test='1' order by u2.timestamp desc limit 28;
	# 1 Monat (alle 24 Stunden)
	set @a:=0; select u1.timestamp, u1.clients from (select @a:=@a+1,mod(@a,48) as test,timestamp,clients from server_usage) as u2, server_usage as u1 where u1.timestamp=u2.timestamp and u2.test='1' order by u2.timestamp desc limit 30;
- top_all.php: Take care about client and servergroup exceptions!
- stats about client version on index.php instead of current server usage (dublicate)
- thousands delimiter for total bytes on current statsitics (index.php)
- all textes to lang.php
- nations to longtext
- servericon on servername (index.php), if set
- what is with sites top user of week and top users of month
- add dynamic page for user stats like my_stats.php and add link to all other pages, where users are listed, especially on list_rankup.php
- add column deleted in table stats_user and mark user which are not exists any more in table user as deleted and show this attribute also on users stats page
