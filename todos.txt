- jobmanagement (manage start jobs for predefined time, controll success, log management)
- source out session handling out of stats sites into other/session.php
- what happens, when a user is not connected to teamspeak (-> no session), individual interception for each stats site
- correct session handling.. handle outdated session for user which idle on homepage
- every action (stats and jobs) for ts3 has a check for slow mode?
- missed java/css lib or something else? look at ts-n.net/ranksystem_dev/stats/my_stats.php -> legendary icons
- my_stats.php: load informations out of database (at now: count_week, count_month, idle_week, idle_month)
- add list_rankup.php as menu entry in statistic and embed it (is the only logical way)
- undefined variable $idle_res_final in index.php
- use for all stats site a queryconnect with a different name.. like in jobs
- add server-usage graph on index.php with following dropdown options
	# 1 Tag (alle 60 Minuten)
	set @a:=0; select u1.timestamp, u1.clients from (select @a:=@a+1,mod(@a,2) as test,timestamp,clients from server_usage) as u2, server_usage as u1 where u1.timestamp=u2.timestamp and u2.test='1' order by u2.timestamp desc limit 24;
	# 1 Woche (alle 6 Std)
	set @a:=0; select u1.timestamp, u1.clients from (select @a:=@a+1,mod(@a,12) as test,timestamp,clients from server_usage) as u2, server_usage as u1 where u1.timestamp=u2.timestamp and u2.test='1' order by u2.timestamp desc limit 28;
	# 1 Monat (alle 24 Stunden)
	set @a:=0; select u1.timestamp, u1.clients from (select @a:=@a+1,mod(@a,48) as test,timestamp,clients from server_usage) as u2, server_usage as u1 where u1.timestamp=u2.timestamp and u2.test='1' order by u2.timestamp desc limit 30;
- top_all.php: Take care about client and servergroup exceptions!
- stats about client version on index.php instead of current server usage (dublicate)
- thousands delimiter for total bytes on current statsitics (index.php)
- all textes to lang.php
- nations to longtext
- servericon on servername (index.php), if set
- handle exception NULL value on "Online Time Month" and "Online Time Week" -> something like "not enough data yet"
- Info on index.php: example "This site gets his informations out of a database. The values get refreshed every minute."
- what is with sites top user of week and top users of month

- search for errors (stats and jobs) about error-log
- check all stats site with https://validator.w3.org/ and correct errors

-My_Stats.php info button legendary icons
-webinterface "Admin List" Button funktioniert nichtmehr durch neuen path

-in der index.php ist die Server Usage jetzt sehr "ungenau", da dieser Wert nur jede halbe Stunde geupdated wird
