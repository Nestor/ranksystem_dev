- list rankup when scrolling the "info header" doesnt attach to top navbar
=======
- client_flag_avatar = md5sum of avatar file; once this changes -> download the new avatar
- job_calc_stats; set server to offline, if connection to ts3 server failed
- session.php set "not connected" information in session and do not try to connect with every site change to ts3 server again (prevent spam and better load, when server is down)
